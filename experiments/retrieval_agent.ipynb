Some of the key Vision 2030 projects include the Diriyah Gate project in Diriyah, the Al-Ula development project in Al-Ula, and the Neom project in northwestern Saudi Arabia. These projects focus on cultural preservation, tourism development, technological innovation, and sustainable living practices to help achieve the goals set out in Vision 2030. Additionally, the promotion of Saudi coffee (Gahwa) as part of intangible cultural heritage is another aspect of Vision 2030 aimed at enhancing cultural tourism.\n"
